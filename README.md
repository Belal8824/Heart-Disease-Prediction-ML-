# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML-Model
## Heart Disease Prediction System
This is my first Machine Learning project where I built a system to predict heart disease using the **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** algorithm.

## Project Highlights:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in Cholesterol.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized gender distribution and heart disease correlations.
- **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy score of **87%**.

## Built With:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
